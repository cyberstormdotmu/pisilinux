/etc/config/dropbear


Sections:

The dropbear configuration contains settings for the dropbear SSH server in a single section.

The dropbear section contains these settings:
Name 	Type 	Required 	Default 	Description
enable 	boolean 	no 	1 	Set to 0 to disable starting dropbear at system boot.
verbose 	boolean 	no 	0 	Set to 1 to enable verbose output by the start script.
BannerFile 	string 	no 	(none) 	Name of a file to be printed before the user has authenticated successfully.
PasswordAuth 	boolean 	no 	1 	Set to 0 to disable authenticating with passwords.
Port 	integer 	no 	22 	Port number to listen on.
RootPasswordAuth 	boolean 	no 	1 	Set to 0 to disable authenticating as root with passwords.
RootLogin 	boolean 	no 	1 	Set to 0 to disable SSH logins as root.
GatewayPorts 	boolean 	no 	? 	Set to 1 to allow remote hosts to connect to forwarded ports.
Interface 	string 	no 	(none) 	Tells dropbear to listen only on the specified interface.1)

This is the default configuration: 

config dropbear
        option PasswordAuth 'on'
        option RootPasswordAuth 'on'
        option Port         '22'
        
        
Multiple dropbear instances:

Edit /etc/config/dropbear to add a second instance.

vi /etc/config/dropbear

The below example shows one on port 22 on the lan side, one on port 2022 on the wan side. Note: wan side is set for PasswordAuth off so make sure you have added an ssh-key.

Also make sure to check your firewall DNAT (port forward) to allow access to the wan side port, 2022 in this case.

config dropbear
        option PasswordAuth 'on'
        option Port '22'
        option Interface 'lan'

config dropbear
        option PasswordAuth 'off'
        option Interface 'wan'
        option Port '2022'

If you try to run multiple dropbear instances and they are not started you probably have a timing issue. To fix the timing issue just create a small hotplug script in /etc/hotplug.d/iface/40-dropbear that simply restarts dropbear after the WAN interface is restarted.

/etc/hotplug.d/iface/40-dropbear

#!/bin/sh

if [ "$INTERFACE" = "wan" ] && [ "$ACTION" = "ifup" ]
then
        /etc/init.d/dropbear restart
fi
