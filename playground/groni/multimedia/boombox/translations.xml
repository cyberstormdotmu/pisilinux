        <Description xml:lang="tr">BoomBox is an audio player with built-in database for easy browsing of local music files. It has no playlist, instead it simply plays songs from current search results. These queries can be saved to give you something like "dynamic playlists". It also has support for queing up songs to be played, replacing much of the need for a playlist.</Description>
