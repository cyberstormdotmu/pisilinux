        <Summary xml:lang="tr">GrooveOff is an unofficial client for grooveshark.com.</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="tr">With it you can search its huge database (thanks to a public api) for artists, songs and albums and save them on disk for offline playing. It provides easy to use filters by artists and albums. I embedded also a minimal player for songs preview/listening so you may decide to keep/reject them. </Description>
