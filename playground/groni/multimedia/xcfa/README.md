XCFA needs Codecs for the encoding.
A lot of Codecs are installed in Pisi Linux and where detect, but any codecs or helpers are not installed.
Please check the Plugins in XCFA > External Programms all green Entries are installed Codecs, all with the red Dot they are not installed.
You need not all Codecs, that is your own choice and what you will encode any Packages are optional.

The available Codecs/Helpers in Pisi Linux for XCFA are the following:

cdparanoia
faac
faad
flac
icedax
lame
lsdvd

Should one of this have a red Dot in XCFA please open the Package Manager give it in and install it, these Packages are suggestions and optional for XCFA.
Any Packages came later here on the GitHub or in the Repository from Pisi Linux.
