XDM
For XDM, you will need to have the ~/.xsession file in your home folder. If you do not have one, create it. XDM reads this file as a script. See the XDM documentation for more information. The final line in your ~/.xsession file should read:

exec startlxde
If you are starting X with startx, the same line would go in your ~/.xinitrc file.
