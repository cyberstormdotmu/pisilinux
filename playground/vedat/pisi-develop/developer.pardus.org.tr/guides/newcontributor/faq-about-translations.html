<h2>1. Internationalization (i18n)<a class="headerlink" href="#internationalization-i18n" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that
it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
This is actually what we are doing when we write the software components like
Managers, YALI, Kaptan, sysinfo, etc, so this isn&#8217;t a process that you&#8217;re
directly involved.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, all the strings in an application presented to the
user are wrapped with a function call like i18n(), ki18n(), etc. That&#8217;s all.
Say that you&#8217;re printing a welcome message on the screen in Python:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Hello&quot;</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t at all translatable to any language as it doesn&#8217;t support i18n. But
if I import the relevant module and wrap that string by the relevant function
like:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">i18n(&quot;Hello&quot;)</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>the text will be replaced by the meaning of &#8220;Hello&#8221; in the corresponding
language when a user runs the application.</p>
<p>When the whole software is internationalized, a translation catalogue (a file
with an extension .pot) is generated by browsing all the source code files of
that software.  The catalogue is actually a plain text file which keeps the
strings to be translated and their corresponding translations in a 2-line
format:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># Some comments about where this string is actually
# coming from in terms of source code file and line number
msgid "string to be translated 1"
msgstr ""</pre>
</div>
<p>and it goes like this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="localization-l10n">
<h2>2. Localization (l10n)<a class="headerlink" href="#localization-l10n" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a
specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and
translating text.</p>
<p>Localization is actually what you are doing: Translating the English strings in
the translation catalogue to another language.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflow-between-i18n-and-l10n">
<h2>3. Workflow between i18n and l10n<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow-between-i18n-and-l10n" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The developer writes its software with i18n support,</li>
<li>Once he/she thinks that it&#8217;s ready for localization, he/she generates a
translation catalogue from it, basically a .pot file and makes it publicly
available to you (through SVN in our case),</li>
<li>The translator takes that .pot file and creates a copy of it which he/she
calls LANGUAGE.po, e.g.  If I&#8217;m translating the software to Turkish, I
take that .pot file and create a copy of it called tr.po.</li>
<li>I use vi, nano, mcedit, lokalize, kbabel, or another application to edit
that tr.po file for translating the strings in it,</li>
<li>Once I think that it&#8217;s enough for that day, I commit it back to where it
belongs in the SVN tree.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Some more practical rules and advises are below:</blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You never touch/modify the .pot file once you copy it as your LANGUAGE.po
file,</li>
<li>If there&#8217;s already a LANGUAGE.po file then it means that somebody has
already started working on it OR the developer of the software had created
empty LANGUAGE.po files for your convenience. All you have to do is to
edit it to fix broken or missing translations and commit it back!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-happens-when-i-translate-and-commit-the-language-po-file-to-svn">
<h2>4. What happens when I translate and commit the LANGUAGE.po file to SVN?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-when-i-translate-and-commit-the-language-po-file-to-svn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The developers creates a tarball/archive of their project source codes
including the po/ directory which contains all of the translation work done by
you. Once the application becomes a pisi package and you install/upgrade it on
your system, the new translations will immediately be available to you.</p>
<p>If you think that you translated all the strings correctly and committed the
LANGUAGE.po file to SVN, you may sit back and enjoy seeing your translation
work on your screen as you use the related software.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="oh-i-thought-i-already-completed-the-translation-of-kaptan-but-there-are-still-english-messages-in-it">
<h2>5. Oh, I thought I already completed the translation of Kaptan but there are still English messages in it!<a class="headerlink" href="#oh-i-thought-i-already-completed-the-translation-of-kaptan-but-there-are-still-english-messages-in-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Okay, there could be more than one possible cause for this problem. Let&#8217;s
learn about them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">You really completed the LANGUAGE.po file and committed it but the
maintainer of the project wasn&#8217;t concerned at all to create a new tarball
and push that as a pisi update to the repository. So your works aren&#8217;t
reflected at all to the package. Just send an e-mail to the
pardus-translators list as early as possible OR fire a bug report in
bugzilla to poke us,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You really completed the LANGUAGE.po file and committed it but to the
wrong directory under SVN. We&#8217;ll talk about different directory
hierarchies in SVN a little bit later so keep reading,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You really think you&#8217;re completed the LANGUAGE.po file but actually there
are translations which are marked as fuzzy.  When a translation is marked
as fuzzy, the English string is displayed instead of the fuzzy
translation. You have to correct that translation and remove the fuzzy
mark in the .po file. Let&#8217;s see an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>#, fuzzy
msgid "Network settings"
msgstr "A not-really correct phrase about the original string"</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, that translation is marked as fuzzy and you&#8217;ll just see
&#8220;Network settings&#8221; instead of the not-really correct fuzzy translation. If
you&#8217;re using a graphical tool, re-translating it correctly should be
sufficient to mark it as non-fuzzy. If you&#8217;re using a text editor, just
remove that &#8220;, fuzzy&#8221; from the line above, that&#8217;s all,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You really completed the LANGUAGE.po file but the developer has just added
a new string and you didn&#8217;t notice it at all.  In that case your
LANGUAGE.po file will miss the translation for that new string which will
cause it to be displayed in English. Just open the LANGUAGE.po file,
translate the newly added strings and commit it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>At the bottom of my LANGUAGE.po file there a lot of translations all starting with #. What am I supposed to do with them?</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing! Those are old translations that you&#8217;ve made a while ago but which are
not currently used by the application because the developer decided to not make
them appear on the screen.</p>
<p>When the developer updates the POT and PO files (Don&#8217;t panic we&#8217;ll talk about
that too), the removed strings and their translations will be moved to the
bottom of the PO files and be commented out with # characters so that they are
not used at all.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>I sometimes see that the POT file and all the PO files are modified, what does it mean?</li>
</ol>
<p>When a developer adds/removes/modifies some strings in its project source
codes, he runs an automated script which reflects that change to the POT and
PO files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">If there is/are new string(s), you just have to translate it/them in
LANGUAGE.po and commit your changes back,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If there is/are removed string(s), its/theirs translation(s) for it/them in
the PO file is/are moved to the bottom of the file and each commented out
with an # character. You don&#8217;t have to do anything in this case,</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If there is/are modified string(s), its/theirs translation becomes fuzzy.
When you open the LANGUAGE.po file with your favourite localization tool or a
text editor, you&#8217;ll see that the relevant translations is/are marked as fuzzy
(has a # ,fuzzy line above it).  You now have to fix its/their translation(s)
to unmark it/them as fuzzy.</p>
<p>Note that you&#8217;ll see the original English strings instead of fuzzy marked
translations when you run an application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>I&#8217;m really confused about the branch/ and trunk/ hierarchy in Pardus SVN
repository. What are they used for? Where should I commit my translation
updates?</li>
</ol>
<p>You&#8217;re basically working in uludag repository (<a class="reference external" href="http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag">http://svn.pardus.org.tr/uludag</a>)
which contains the source codes for Pardus technologies.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>An SVN project repository is generally divided into three folders:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>trunk/</li>
<li>branches/</li>
<li>tags/</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>&#8220;trunk&#8221; is the directory under which the main project development occurs,
&#8220;branches&#8221; is the directory in which you create various named branches of the
main development line, &#8220;tags&#8221; is a directory of branches that are created, and
perhaps destroyed but never changed.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s forget about tags directory and focus over the other ones.</p>
<p>In trunk, there are several directories for several projects like Kaptan, YALI,
comar, pisi, kde, etc. This where the main development takes place.  For
example, when I found a bug in Kaptan, trunk/kde/kaptan is generally the first
place where I commit my fix.</p>
<p>If I plan to do radical changes to Kaptan e.g. to add different features to it
that will be used in Pardus 2011 but which will not appear in Pardus 2009, I
create a branch in branches/kde/kaptan called for example 2011 and I continue
the development in trunk/kde/kaptan and branches/kde/kaptan/2011 separately.</p>
<p>So, If I add a new string to the 2011 branch of Kaptan and update the POT/PO
files, you have to update the relevant PO files in branches/kde/kaptan/2011/po
directory.</p>
<p>Currently we have two main branches for every project: 2009 and Corporate2.
Both are active and maintained so you should generally be updating both
branches for every project if you see a translation update in uludag-commits.</p>
<p>If there are no modifications to the strings in a specific branch of Kaptan,
and you continue to improve the current translations in trunk/kde/kaptan, this
is the developer&#8217;s responsibility to take what you changed in trunk/kde/kaptan
and apply them over the relevant branches of Kaptan.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>It is quite possible to see untranslated strings in KDE applications.
Since KDE isn&#8217;t maintained in uludag/ repository, where should I update the translations?</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice question! This is one of the mysteries for translators. From time to time,
we add new features to the KDE applications that needs for example a button in
the user interface of that application.</p>
<p>The PO files for KDE applications are either coming from the package itself or
from kde-l10n-LANGUAGE packages in the repository.</p>
<p>For example, we recently added a new item in the right-click menu of KMix (The
speaker icon in your system tray) which opens pavucontrol for advanced sound
settings. The feature was added to KMix shipped within the kdemultimedia
package. As kdemultimedia is a base KDE package, all of its PO files comes from
kde-l10n-LANGUAGE packages.</p>
<p>This is the patch applied to kdemultimedia package which adds that item to
KMix:

<div class="section" id="how-do-i-test-my-translation">
<h2>How do i test my translation?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-test-my-translation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, if you edited the relevant po file with a text editor, you should
test it with &#8220;msgfmt&#8221; command. Ex.:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">msgfmt</span> <span class="pre">-c</span> <span class="pre">--statistics</span> <span class="pre">&lt;insert_your_language&gt;.po</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>The above command first checks whether if there are fatal errors or warnings
with &#8220;-c&#8221; parameter, then shows the statics of your translation file with
&#8220;&#8211;statistics&#8221; parameter, obviously.</p>
<p>The result should be similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>msgfmt -c --statistics tr.po
395 translated messages, 1 untranslated message.</pre>
</div>
<p>If your translation contains missing or extra characters (e.g. extra n,
missing % character, wrong order of %1 and %2), you will get an error like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>msgfmt -c --statistics tr.po
tr.po:28: `msgid' and `msgstr' entries do not both end with '\n'
msgfmt: found 1 fatal error
395 translated messages, 1 untranslated message.</pre>
</div>
<p>The above output tries to tell us that we have an extra &#8220;n&#8221; character on line
28. We should fix it and then repeat the routine again.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the result, compile your po file with the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">msgfmt</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">&lt;application&gt;.mo</span> <span class="pre">language.po</span></tt></blockquote>
<p>This command compiles your po file into a binary format, &lt;application&gt;.mo.
Most of the translation files (compiled ones, mo that is) usually stays in
/usr/share/locale/&lt;language&gt;/LC_MESSAGES directory. KDE has its prefix so KDE
related programs have their translation files in
/usr/kde/4/share/locale/&lt;language&gt;/LC_MESSAGES. If you want to test your
translation effort, copy your mo file to relevant directory. Here&#8217;s a routine i
use for translating kaptan:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>pwd
/home/igungor/bluebox/uludag/trunk/kde/kaptan/po</li>
<li>vim tr.po (type type type, delete, type, delete. save and exit.)
(You can use your favourite text editor of course.)</li>
<li>msgfmt -c &#8211;statistics tr.po
154 translated messages, 6 untranslated messages.
(OK, no warning or fatal error. lets compile it)</li>
<li>msgfmt -o kaptan.mo tr.po
(we have kaptan.mo in our current working directory after this command if
you get no output from this command.)</li>
<li>sudo mv kaptan.mo /usr/kde/4/share/locale/tr/LC_MESSAGES/kaptan.mo</li>
<li>LC_ALL=tr_TR kaptan
(If you are using and English locale and test your application with
another locale, you can use this command to change your locale for this
application.)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Voila! We have freshly translated Kaptan now. It is time to commit our changes.</p>
