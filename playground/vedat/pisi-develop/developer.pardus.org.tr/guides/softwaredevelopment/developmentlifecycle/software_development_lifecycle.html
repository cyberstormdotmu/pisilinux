<p>Project initialization starts with the statement of requirement description includes the main function of the software with one or two sentences made by the person or people who requested the software. This explanation could be illustrated as below:</p>
<blockquote>
“It is necessary a graphical user interface for the user management in the system.”</blockquote>
<p>A Project leader is determined after the person who requested the software convey this information to the Operational Coordinator.</p>
<p>After the Project Leader is determined, a representational code name is determined for the project and with this name a project is opened under Pardus Project Tracking System (tracker.pardus.org.tr). It could be expressed as a sub-project of another project in accordance with the project requirements. It will be appropriate the participation of the responsable of the superior project -even as a consultant- to the project in question in this condition. Furthermore, depending on the privacy status of the project, it is created a working directory at one of the code repositories “internal” or “uludag” under the subdirectory related to the topic. The information and documents related to all the studies should be stored under this directory. All progress should be carried out over the Project Tracking System and all the information and documents should be stores under the project&#8217;s working directory. Even if it has become absolute that a document put in the directory is not necessary anymore, it should not be removed for the purpose of recording; it should be presented to the required units within the “Project Final Report” when the project at available version or the project is at the end. In addition, an e-mail list could be opened for the purpose of the project issues&#8217; discussion, in the circumstance of the need for the project.</p>
<p>The working repository should be opened under &#8220;internal&#8221; or &#8220;projects&#8221; repositories together with the specified code name depending on the privacy status of the project.</p>

<h3>Pardus Software Life Cycle and Work Breakdown<a class="headerlink" href="#pardus-software-life-cycle-and-work-breakdown" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section is to learn how we name the sections that make up a software project and how to manage them.</p>
<p>Every software has a lifecycle. To develop a project we will use a balanced combination of Incremental, V Shaped and Prototyping software development life cycles specialized for Pardus.</p>
<p>You can see details from <a class="reference external" href="software_development_lifecycle-2.html">Software Development Life Cycle</a> image.</p>
<p>A Pardus software project is made up of several sections:</p>
<div class="section" id="phase">
<h4>Phase<a class="headerlink" href="#phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Defines the major activities that every project must have. Every Phase is a <strong>sub-project</strong> of the main project.
Each phase has a beginning and ending date.</p>
<p>A minimal Pardus software project <strong>must</strong> have the following phases:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Requirements Phase</strong>:
Each project starts with the Requirements Phase.</p>
<p>The requirements phase include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Gathering Requirements</li>
<li>Preparing the requirements specifications document (RSD)</li>
<li>Requirements Analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Design Phase</strong>:
The second phase is usually the Design Phase. In some projects there can also be an equipment preparation phase before or after this phase.</p>
<p>A software design should be detailed so the programmer that translates the design to a programming language does not have to make any decisions while developing the software.</p>
<p>The design should be supported with UML diagrams such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Activity Diagrams</li>
<li>Interaction Diagrams</li>
<li>Class Diagrams</li>
<li>Sequence Diagrams</li>
</ul>
<p>Software design are divided in two:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>High Level Design</strong></p>
<p>A high-level design provides an overview of a solution, platform, system, product, service, or process. The purpose is the show the big picture.</p>
<p>High level design includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Architecture</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>Networks</li>
<li>High level data flow</li>
<li>Optional: Classes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Low Level Design</strong></p>
<p>A low-level design contains the details of the high level design. At the end of the low level design, the code should be <strong>all but written</strong>.</p>
<p>Low level design includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Associations between classes</li>
<li>Member and non-member functions</li>
<li>Member variables</li>
<li>Any other detail that are involved in testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Implementation Phase</strong>:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
Implementation phase is translating the design to a programming language without making any design decisions.</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><strong>Testing Phase</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing phase includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Unit testing (test cases will be run automatically by <strong>Buildbot</strong>)</li>
<li>Alpha tests</li>
<li>Beta tests</li>
<li>Acceptance test</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests can run parallel with the Implementation Phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><strong>Maintenance Phase</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintenance Phase starts after the first version of the software (after Beta version) is released.</p>
<p>Includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Updating the software</li>
<li>Fixing bugs</li>
<li>Optimizations</li>
<li>Implementing new technologies</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation of Standard Software Documents<a class="headerlink" href="#preparation-of-standard-software-documents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To maintain the standard software development processes and to achieve the coding process through these standards, the reports/documents listed below should be prepared at the beginning of the coding stage and should be included in the project documentation. It should not be forgotten that all the developing process will be done based on these documents. It could be made changes on these documents in need and these documents should be in their own version numbers.</p>
<p>The task of preparing these documents are performed by the specified person/people in the project team and if necessary, by the participation of the demander(s) of the project. As with all other work, the work tracking system should be used for the preparation and development process of these documents. These documents could be shared between the module developers.</p>

<h4>Defining Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A detailed class table is prepared for the all functions that are planned to be used at the beginning of the coding process, in terms of this table, API/library design is determined in a flexible way as possible and in accordance with the requirements of the project. The API/library design should be documented besides and it should not be forgotten that it will be the most comprehensive document of the project in technical sense.</p>

<p>A similar one of the class table, which is defined for the properties and processes will be used, is prepared for the interfaces, if necessary. This table could include the interfaces that is necessary to cover the requirements specified in the user requirements document, the tasks of these interfaces and in addition of these, a mockup will be prepared for the interface. Furthermore, in the projects that need multi-interface, the interface transitions should be indicated on a flow diagram.</p>
<p>The features that are determined when designinig the interface, should be prepared to fulfill the user requirements. It could be back to user requirements table if possible differences emerge, however this is not a preferred process. It should not be forgotten that the main goal of the interfaces is to fulfill the requirements.</p>

<p>A report including all libraries will be used as external and their dependencies should be prepared an it should be updated for each change has been done. The content of this report should not be in a conflict with the constraints specified in the requirements table. For example;</p>
<blockquote>
“The product should be able to work in Linux Systems.”</blockquote>
<p>the external dependencies of a project with such a constraint in the above sentence should be able to compatible with the Linux systems.</p>

<h4>Testing Process<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>During the coding process, for each module performed; the module&#8217;s code is tested primarily by its developer. These tests should be carried out as described in the &#8220;Software Tests&#8221; document and for each module, its developer&#8217;s approval, about the module is carried out before that version, should be gained.</p>
<p>Module tests include the following testing processes. The person/people who will carry out the test procedures should be specified in advance in the project document.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Requirement tests</li>
<li>Installation tests</li>
<li>Test team&#8217;s tests</li>

<li>The tag mechanism is used effectively, if supported (Git supports), in the storage will be used for the project. This tagging could be carried out for every prototype version. The standarts of the versioning are also placed under the title of Version Numbers.</li>
<li>In this release, the expectation from the project is primarily fulfill the project initial sentence. Prototype version could be determined as a target version for also some of the detailed requirements introduced based on this sentence.</li>
<li>Prototype version could reveal clear data in the course of the project and in some circumstances, it could even lead the project to return the process of the project requirements.

(Main Version Number).(Sub Version Number).(Revision Number).(Build Number)</blockquote>
<p>Need to change of Main Version Number is decided according to the content of changes made compared a version before. The addition of a new module is not available in the previous version to the system is a sufficient reason to increase the Sub Version Number. Revision Number could be increased after each change that should be included in the application; for this number, change number in the repository could be based on. Build Number is important for users and test team rather than developers, this number is increased in every condition that the product is packaged and resend to the user/tester. And rather than versioning, it is updated independent of the project, depending on the package management sytem that the packaging process is done and repository conditions is located at.</p>
